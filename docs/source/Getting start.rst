Getting start
===============

Overview
---------
The `sinupy` package makes it convenient to analyze the characteristic sinusoidal waves propagating in various kinds of medium. Typical waves in plasma have been given in the [example](https://sinupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) to demonstrate how the package works and other users are free to follow the steps to research on their medium or charcteristic waves of interest.

Who can use?
-------------
The package is totally based on the python. So it's recommend to learn python first and the symbolic algebra of the wave equations are
achieved by using `sympy` package. The `sympy` is a Python library for symbolic mathematics which will make your code Simple and elegant.

This package is mainly aiming to solve the electromagnetic waves in defferent materials.The material used in example is the plasma and you can found the defferent wave propagation in the plasma.
If you want, it's easily to switch to calculate electromagnetic waves in other materials. See the [Develop Guide] for more information.
